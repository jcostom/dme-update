## Python-based DNS Made Easy Updater in Docker Container

Much like the jcostom/dnsomatic-update project, this uses the DNS Made Easy API to update DNS entries and will (before long) send similar Telegram notifications out (again, optionally).

This is super early-stage. Not even close to ready to be built or used. Chill out for now, gang.

Soon.
